fn main(){

    println!("Hello World!!");
    // ^ this line prints the string on the screen
}

// main function is the first thing that runs when Rust program/code is executed

// function body is wrapped in curly braces {}

// println! is a macro, not a function. if it was a function it would be without
// "!" i.e println()

// Rust style is to indent the line with four spaces, not a tab
